Spash screen is the first screen which appears when an user opens an application. It usually contains the logo of the application with the main caption.
<br>
<br>
Basic idea is to create a full screen activity which will contain the basic logo and other splash screen details. 
The activity will also contain a thread which will sleep for 1 second (splash screen time) and will then call the finish() function. 
This activity will be initiated from the main activity.
